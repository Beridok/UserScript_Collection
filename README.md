# UserScript_Collection
Collection of my own UserScripts for [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net).

Nothing too fancy, usually usefulness is limited to one new function.

Those are codes that can be shown officially.
Some of my codes refer to 18+ sites, therefore I don't show them publicly.

Some of UserScripts are configurable - on top of each code, there are variables that can be adjusted by the user to reflect his preferences or might try to resolve some performance issues (when script is using setInterval and setTimeout functions).

## [AliExpress_MiniHelper](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/AliExpress_MiniHelper.user.js)
Simple script that will move your view down, so it can start loading images from AliExpress item page.

I usually do open multiple item pages at the same time and then check them one by one, therefore it's annoying to wait for description to be loaded. Script is trying to solve this problem and "force" description and images to load in a pretty hacky way.

## [CDA_QualityChange](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/CDA_QualityChange_outdated.user.js) (outdated)
This script used to change quality of video player, based on parameter in URL.

## [HLTB_DefaultValuePicker](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/HLTB_DefaultValuePicker.user.js)
Script used on [HowLongToBeat.com](https://HowLongToBeat.com) - I was tired of reinserting same data with each submission, therefore I made script that fills textareas, checks fields, selects items from lists, etc.

This script also contains other codes in multiline comments - scripts that were used on HLTB's import of Steam games functionality to prevent changing hundreds of positions manually, based on simple criteria (playtime and keywords).

## [HLTB_ShortcutInSteamStore](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/HLTB_ShortcutInSteamStore.user.js)
Simply adds one button on Steam store page, example link: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/TrackMania_Nations_Forever/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/TrackMania_Nations_Forever/)

## [Loader.toHelper](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/Loader.toHelper.user.js)
Automatic click, when loading is done - to download videos from Youtube...

## [QoolerTMX](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/QoolerTMX.user.js) (outdated)
This script became outdated with temporare shutdown of TM-Exchange, as result of attack. [Source.](https://blog.mania.exchange/posts/tmx-united-security-breach)

Main principle is to get additional data from TMX API, that was not public before, that allows to determine how old is replay (score) uploaded on track's page.

Script's purpose was explained in video (click thumbnail for Youtube video):

## [SteamVideoPlayerHelper](https://github.com/Beridok/UserScript_Collection/blob/main/SteamVideoPlayerHelper.user.js)
Changing default playback options (speed and subtitles) in Steam video player. Because I like watching videos in faster playback (to get to know something earlier; and spend less time watching/listening)
